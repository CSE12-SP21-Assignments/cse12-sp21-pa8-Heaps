# PA8: Heaps (open)
---

**This assignment is open to collaboration.**

This assignment will teach you how to implement a Heap using Dijkstra's Algorithm.

This PA is due on ** **Friday, June 4 at 11:59pm** **

Note that for MazeSolver tests, your output doesn't have to be exactly the same as in the document above. However, your output does need to have the same cost as the reference output.

## Part 1: An Implementation of `Heap` (18 points)

You will create a file named `Heap.java` where you will implment the `Heap` class. You will implement all the methods defined in the given interface `PriorityQueue.java` in the `Heap` class as well as additional methods described below.

### Import Statements
For `Heap.java`, you are allowed to use the following Java packages:
```
import java.util.List;
import java.util.NoSuchElementException;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Comparator;
```

*Do **NOT** import any additional packages!*

### `Entry` Class
Copy the following code into your `Heap.java` file. This will be an outer class that represents the entries for the heap. Note, the key represents the priority.

```
class Entry<K, V> {
    K key; // aka the _priority_
    V value;
    public Entry(K k, V v) { this.key = k; this.value = v; }
    public String toString() {
        return key + ": " + value;
    }
}
```


### `Heap` Class
#### Instance Variables
- `public List<Entry<K, V>> entries`: Instead of creating a tree of entries, we will use a list to maintain the heap structure.
- `public Comparator<K> comparator`: This comparator will be passed into the constructor and will be used to determine which entry objects have more priority based on their keys. This comparator class has one method as follows:

`public int compare(Integer a, Integer b)`: takes in two integers and returns an integer value that represent whether a, takes priority over b. A return value of 0 signifies that the priorities of a and b are equal. A negative return value will signify that a has less priority than b and a positive return value will assume the opposite.



#### Constructor
Your heap implementation will have one constructor that takes a comparator as its argument.
` public Heap(Comparator<K> comparator)`: initializes the instance variables

#### Required Method Descriptions

| Method Name | Description |
|-------------|----------------------|
|`void add(K k, V v)`| Insert a new entry with the given key and value to the end of the heap. Then, `bubbleUp` so that the heap properties are not violated |
|`Entry<K, V> poll()`| Remove and return the root element in the heap. Set the last entry in the heap to the root. Use `bubbleDown` to fix the heap after the removal. If the size is zero, throw `NoSuchElementException()`|
|`Entry<K, V> peek()`| Return the root element of the heap. If the size is zero, throw `NoSuchElementException()`  |
|`List<Entry<K,V>> toArray()`| Return the list of entries. |
|`public boolean isEmpty()`| If the List of entries is empty, return true. Otherwise, return false. |



#### Additional Method Descriptions

| Method Name | Description |
|-------------|----------------------|
|`public int parent(int index)`| Return the parent index. |
|`public int left(int index)`| Return the left child index. |
|`public int right(int index)`| Return the right child index. |
|`public void swap(int i1, int i2)`| Takes the index of two entries and swaps them. |
|`public void bubbleUp(int index)`| A recursive method that moves the entry at the specified `index` to a smaller index (up the tree) while maintaining the heap structure. In the case where the element is equal to the parent, you should **not** swap. |
|`public void bubbleDown(int index)`| A recursive method that moves the entry at the specified `index` to a larger index (down the tree) while maintaining the heap structure. Swap with the child with higher priority. If both chilren are equal and swapping is needed, **swap with the left child**. In the case where the element is equal to the smaller child, you should **not** swap. However, if the child with high priority has greater priority than the parent, you still must swap.|
|`public boolean existsAndGreater(int index1, int index2)`| Returns true if the entry at index1 is greater than that at index2 (Note: Both entries at the specified indicies must exists for this to be true). Return false otherwise.  |
|`public int size()`| Returns the number of elements in `entries`. |
|`public String toString()`| Returns a string representation of the elements in `entries` (this method is helpful for debugging) |

Your implementation of `Heap` will be graded automatically by tests that we
provide. Weâ€™ve provided a description of all of these tests as a link to HackMD as a part of the starter code.

## Part 2: `MazeSolver` (Dijkstra's Algorithm 15 points)

In pa3 you completed an algorithm that would find the shortest possible path from a start square to a finish square using a queue structure. To extend this concept further, we have added a cost attribute to each square. This cost attribute is an integer value that denotes how costly it is to visit a particular square. The square also has an attribute, runningCost, which denotes the current total cost it took to get to that square from the start square.   

The goal now is not to find the shortest possible path, but rather to minimize the cost from the start square to the finish square. To do so you will use Dijkstra's algorithm along with the priority queue structure (heap) that you constructed in part 1. Follow the following psuedo code to implement the cost minimization algorithm in the `solve` method of `MazeSolver.java`.  

```
1. initialize pq to be a new empty heap // This will be done in the tester file
                                        // and passed into solve as a parameter.
2. add the start square's cost as the key
   and the start square itself as the value to pq
3. while pq is not empty:
4.     let current = remove the first entry from pq (poll)
5.     let currentSquare = current's value
6.     Mark currentSquare as visited
7.     if currentSquare is the finishing square
8.         return currentSquare
9.     else
10.         for each neighbor of currentSquare that isn't a wall and isn't visited
11.            let currentCost = current's key plus the neighbors cost
12.            if currentCost is less than neighbor's runningCost
13.                set the previous of the neighbor to currentSquare
14.                set the neighbors runningCost to currentCost
15.                add the currentCost as key and neighbor as value to the pq (add)
16. if the loop ended, return null (no path found)
```

## Testing
**All test case descriptions available here: https://hackmd.io/@gadjoian/SJPgQRIz**
### Heap - HeapTest.java
In the starter code, we provided the file HeapTest.java to unit test your implementation. **Note**: For this PA, your unit tests will be graded for completion only (i.e. at least 1 test written), however, we **strongly** encourage you to thoroughly test every public method in your class. You are required to have at least one unit test written by yourself. We have provided the descriptions of the tests we'll use to grade your code, so we recommend you incorporate those tests into your HeapTest.java.

### MazeSolver - TestSolver.java
Just like pa3 you will be creating different mazes that you will run your algorithm through to find a path from the start square to the finish square. However, this time there will also be a 2-D cost array that you will include when creating the Maze. We have included one testcase for you to demonstrate how to construct the costArray and create the corresponding Maze. This test should pass when you have finished implementing the solve algorithm. Similar to HeapTest.java, you should include at least one unit test as we will be grading for completion; however, we **strongly** recommend you to look at the test descriptions given and write
as many tests as you can to ensure you'll pass all of the autograder tests.

## Part 3: Gradescope Assignment (6 points)
Answer the questions in *Programming Assignment 8 - questions* on Gradescope. For each coding question, you will need to choose a proper data structure for solving it, such that the time complexity achieved will be optimal. Here is an overview of each question. See more details in the Gradescope assignment.

1. Given a string s containing just the characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[` and `]`, determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets and are closed in the correct order.
2. Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.
3. You're given strings `jewels` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `stones` representing the stones you have. Each character in `stones` is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".


## Clarification
- If you're finding a different path than the ones we've specified, change the order in which you check neighbors and push them into the `PriorityQueue` to be North->South->East->West. The larger graphs could potentially have more than one solution which was not intended.
- You should use `compare` in `existsAndGreater()`, which is where you should check if the indices exists before calling `compare`.
- Your implementation of Heap should simply use the `Comparator` that was passed into it's constructor to do the comparisons. You do not need to specify Min/Max anywhere in your Heap implementation so long as you are correctly using the passed in `Comparator` object.
- `Integer::compare` will result in a max heap. `Collections.reverseOrder(Integer::compare)` will result in a min heap.

## Style (5 points)

The following files will be graded on style:

* Heap.Java
* HeapTest.java
* MazeSolver.java
* TestSolvers.java

To find the full style guideline, follow this link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XCwv_vHrp1X4vmlmNJIiXnxPuRLPZQkQEGNrJHJ0Ong/edit?usp=sharing
